# Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC)
In this text, we are going to be using **Vigor Decentralized Autonomous Community** (**VDAC**) as an actual example of a possibly successful case of a DAC. Also here, when the word *"the" or "our" community* is used, it will always refer to VDAC unless otherwise notified.

### On its intention
VDAC is a group of people with the intention to actualize, within the group itself, the concepts of decentralization, autonomy, and community. Later on, we are going to talk more about it but for now let's bear in mind that it is very transformative to have this intention, the group's intention, written in the VDAC vision statement in order to have a very clear guide for all actions of VDAC members.

There are two pieces of texts that serve as guidance to the group’s intention achievement, also. To be known, the [approved constitution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigorstablecoin/constitution/master/constitution.md) and the [whitepaper](https://docs.vigor.ai/docs/en/whitepaper).  Nevertheless, it is paramount to remember, in case one has forgotten, that what governs the VDAC is the interpretation given to those two texts by the ones in charge of the group, in our case here, the ones called **custodians**.

### On its vision
Any community is a kind of organization and for its own sake, it should have a **vision** statement. The vision statement ought to be a picture of your organization projected many years into the future. It is how you see your organization in 20 or 30 years from now. Also, it is good to bear in mind that the vision of one organization has more to do with products or services it delivers to society.

### On its intention again
Even more important than the vision statement, is its **reasoning** statement or the **“why”** statement. This statement ought to give the reason why the organization wants to serve the society with its products or services. It is the big 'why' the organization is working towards its vision. And it has more to do with the moral behind the organization's products or services. Ultimately, it is the most profound differentiation of the organization and it is the reason why it exists.

Any misunderstanding of this concept above or delinquency in not giving the just amount of importance will most likely drive the organization into error. Where the organization will become schizophrenic -doing and saying one thing, yet walking towards another completely different thing.   

#### On an important detail about the statements
Bring in mind that many times the vision and reasoning statements come together in only one phrase, making it difficult to notice the two concepts within there. Nevertheless, if this is the case, they are within there hidden behind keywords. It is much better, though, to have it separated into two complete and clear sentences.  

* VDAC vision statement __________________________________.
* VDAC “why” statement _____________________________.

### VDAC vision statement
 In the [EOS Hot Sauce episode 65](https://eosnation.io/eos-hot-sauce-65/) we do have a sentence of Andrew in which he states the vision of VDAC, saying:

>“that crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users." 

And, if I may, I would like to suggest this as an addition, _"and for its users where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always."_ Then, the whole statement could be written as follows: 

VDAC’s vision statement: **To be that crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users and for its users where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always**.

## Let's start
Assuming that the vision is the one we have right now and that even if the community chooses to change all the words yet keeping the same meaning, we can start moving forward with this conversation. The first thing we want to have is the actual picture of the VDAC in the present. We will not mind why it is how it is, and we are not going to judge it as well. It is just a picture so that we can have a clear view of the situation. And with a clear understanding, we can create a narrative that will serve as a solution for any possible identified problem.

### On VDAC's picture: a simple narrative of what it is
VDAC snapshot of July 2020, shows as it follows: a group of people who identify themselves as a decentralized autonomous community and who express the intention of being a decentralized autonomous community too. The group has a financial product which is a platform where users can lend, borrow, and insure tokens. This platform runs on top of two tokens which essentially exercises functions of 3 tokens: 1- VIGOR token which value is a US dollar peg; 2- VIG token which is a utility token you can pay fees on the platform, you can be rewarded for using the platform or you can be rewarded for being a VDAC member. The VIG token is used as a final reserve token too. 3- There is a third function of VIG token which is essentially linked to the custodians, having nothing to do with the VIG token itself. This is the governmental function used as a vote that counts. Here we are going to refer to this third function as VIGG to differentiate it from VIG if the need to use this appears. Moving forward we see that among all group's actions, we want to separate them into two: first, the ones registered on the blockchain, and secondly, the ones not.
 - Registered on the blockchain: 
	 - There are four ways to interact with the VDAC. Those interactions are divided into two: it can be as users, or as members, or both. The group itself is divided into 3 classes of members representing 3 interactions: 
		 - The first class is made of the 21 most voted members, called custodians, and they are the only ones whose votes count, and the only ones who can assign the multsig contracts, therefore the only ones who do govern.
			 -**Governance**: This governance is made by the majority of custodians' votes where 11 votes, from the 21, can execute a multsig proposal. Therefore, only custodians can vote among themselves, and choose who gets in or who gets out. And there is no way how to interfere with that.
		 - The second class is made of members that have received at least one vote, called candidates, and they do nothing in the governance, and their main role is to be there serving as candidates to the custodian rule. 
		 - The third class is made of members that have received none vote, called just like members, and they do nothing in governance; they are just there. 
		 - The last interaction belongs to the users -they are only users of the product and do nothing in the governance.
	 - There is a payment method where all 3 classes of members receive VIG tokens, according to an equation, proportionally to how many votes they received (or received not,) and the amount set in their Request Reward Claim option.
 - Not registered on the blockchain: 
	 - The group has many human activities that can be easily summarized as follows: Conversation through group chats manly on the telegram, where people, mostly VDAC members, talk and come to agreements on very important matters such as governance, legal complacency, marketing, and also programming code. All of those conversations take place also through group calls manly on the Zoom platform.

#### First case: governance voting walking towards decentralization
First, let's have a general introduction talking about the possibilities we do have.

##### On the voting systems
The vote is the expression of your personal intention. It can be individual or social and, in any one of those cases, it can be secretive or public. In a society, voting usually in its common sense is an expression of the *energy* you can direct towards the change of a situation or system as a whole. This energy is commonly called the *weight* of your vote.

In this text, we are going to use the term 'weight' only to refer to the **VDAC final vote weight**, and the term '**energy**' to refer to the weight or *power* of any other vote system added to the VDAC final vote weight. 

###### On the democratic vote
When your vote has the same weight as anyone else's vote, you have a democratic vote. Its regime is called democracy. Beyond any doubt, the democratic vote is the most perfect voting system; but not everything that is more perfect meant to be used or applied. There is an issue of applicability: there are perfections that demand actualization (or perfection) of the parts where they are applied or used so that they as a whole could then work properly. For instance, people, in general, are not actualized enough to use such a system of voting, i.e., democratic voting.

Therefore, as expected, whenever and wherever the democratic vote had been installed, you've seen in most of the cases, unfortunately, from their beginnings, the formation of cartels taking over such democratic societies by the means of behaviors such as secret influences or blatant economic trades favoring only a few. Those kinds of behavior have always driven democratic societies into enormous inequalities. And those big inequalities bring with themselves their problems. Further, those problems will lead the social system into disorder, and then its self-destruction. In order to solve those problems usually, we have seen the use of force taking place. This force is exercised by one person or a group, and in any case, it is the triumph of tyranny. This tyranny is well represented nowadays by communist regimes for instance.

###### On the plutocratic vote
If you add the energy that here is representing your wealth into the weight of your vote where the more you have in wealthy the more your vote counts, you do create what is called *plutocratic vote*. Its regime is called an oligarchy. The plutocratic vote fixes the undesired behaviors mentioned above by introducing the energy that represents people's wealth into the system. You can not have a voice represented by your vote if you do not show how much wealth you do have. Now, there is a tendency for all participants interested in the final outcome of any system, to show up and present their wealth, and by doing so, the whole social system is clearer and public and any movement of this energy, the wealth, is easy to spot therefore easy to oversees. Note that, the overseeing action is mandatory in order to block the possible formation of cartels -the only thing different here is that now it is easier to keep this tendency to the formation of cartels in check.

#####  On VDAC final vote weight
As of August 2020, the community is deciding how the composition of the final VDAC vote weight will better express the community heart, i.e., its vision. As this text grows trying and clarifying the community choices, also this composition will change and mature. For now, here is what we have as follows:

 1. [Plutocratic vote energy;](https://github.com/brspma/TEST/blob/master/TEST.md#on-the-plutocratic-vote-first-energy-added-to-the-vdac-final-vote-weight)
 2. [Reputation vote energy;](https://github.com/brspma/TEST/blob/master/TEST.md#on-the-reputation-vote-second-energy-added-to-the-vdac-final-vote-weight)
 3. [NameToBe vote energy;](https://github.com/brspma/TEST/blob/master/TEST.md#on-the-nametobe-vote-third-energy-added-to-the-vdac-final-vote-weight)

A good summary of all I have read so far is that the idea is to architect the VDAC final vote weight using one *mathematical equation*. This math equation would simply sum all different *vote energies* added to the *VDAC final weight* giving to each energy a pre-established percentage as follows:

 -  **VDAC final vote weight = x%[plutocratic vote energy] + x%[reputation energy] + x%[  NameToBe energy] + ....**

Further, each energy added to the VDAC final vote weight will also be manipulated according to the best interest of the community. As it follows:

 1. Plutocratic vote energy = f (plutocratic vote);
 2. Reputation energy = f (user's activity on Vigor platform);
 3. NameToBe energy = f ();
 4. And more energies as it suits the needs of the community. 

The number of energies can be from one to four, essentially. The other variants are accidentals and found themselves circumscribed in the extension of one of those four energies here described. And the reasons behind the number four are that mainly there are two ways to interact with the Vigor Protocol and no more; i.e., as a user of the Vigor platform or as a user of the VDAC or both, and in each interaction, you can measure the mode of the user's participation (this measurement is sometimes objective others subjective yet always valid) giving us four variables, i.e., four energies. Also, consider the term '*mode*' here in its general sense '*modus operandi.*' Each essential energy has characteristics that are unique and here I will give a brief introduction to them for the sake of clarity: ==1- ...text here... 2- ...text here... 3- ...text here...4- ...text here...==

Further, in this text, the term **energy(s)** will always refer to **essential energy(s)** unless otherwise notified. And that because we only use *essential energies* in this text.

For VDAC, as the community matures and grows, we see an evolution in its voting system. As we will see in the following topic, the plutocratic energy will be added to the VDAC voting system when the platform open to the public most likely in September 2020. 

The plutocratic vote energy is one variable added in the *VDAC final vote weight*. And I strongly suggest that we use all *four essential energies* for better circumspection of all possibilities; and better clarity. I hope the community comes to see the importance to add as many essential energies as possible. The expression of the community's intention comes from the control of those essential energies. The more energies to be manipulated as variables, the easier the control. Reminding that any number greater than four starts to add complexity without any need whatsoever, and this would be just a waste of time and energy.

##### On the plutocratic vote: first energy added to the VDAC final vote weight
The plutocratic vote's energy is the power given to the user to change the outcome of the community by his vote. The energy of a plutocratic vote is a straight function of the monetary value he uses in the platform.
As of August 2020, the community has decided, as I understand, to use the energy of the plutocratic vote as one factor in the VDAC final vote weight. This seems wise to me and it adds not only *skin in the game* but also favors the platform in many ways: more liquidity, bigger rewards, more visibility in the industry, and the most important *the mind* behind the plutocratic vote. Also, because you incorporate the monetary value the user brings to the platform, into the equation, it eliminates the chance of big players (whales) try and manipulate the system; instead of this, the community will manipulate *the whales* so that their participation is welcome and healthy to the system by adding great value. 

This manipulation would take place in two steps: first, the mathematical equation of *plutocratic vote energy* would attenuate the difference between the extremes of energies representing the difference between users' monetary value added to the VDAC platform.  Second,  this now attenuated result would be added to a second math equation, *VDAC final vote weight*, that would apply a percentage on top of this result exercising yet another attenuation. This percentage is the amount of influence the community positively wants to give to the plutocratic vote, in relation to the other energies as you can confirm [on VDAC final vote weight](https://github.com/brspma/TEST/blob/master/TEST.md#on-vdac-final-vote-weight).

Finally, let's emphasize what really happens with this implementation into the VDAC voting system. Now we have the community's door opened where the big players and the small ones will have not only a platform to use where all are welcome but a voice all can hear -a true journey into an **inclusive economy**.

##### On its implementation and vulnirability
Before we go on describing how to implement the plutocratic vote, it is necessary to address some issues that may affect its efficiency and success. The first is the [Sybil attack.](https://github.com/brspma/TEST/blob/master/TEST.md#sybil-attack) and we will talk about it later. The second is the fact that the plutocratic vote by itself brings a ***tendency* to conglomerate** affecting the society where it is applied in two ways, in the form of *cartels* compromising the economy or in the form of *usurpation* compromising the governance. 

Note that the conglomerate caused by the plutocratic vote is not a problem in itself, but it is a **vulnerability**. It opens the possibility of the conglomerate to use its power in its own interest instead of the interest of the whole. And because it is a big part comparing to the small users, and some times its size can be problematic even if compared to the whole also, it can cause big damages to the society where it exercises its power. Here I will consider that those two scenarios above are not positively wanted by our community regardless of the how the conglomerate will exercise its power and of its size in relation to the community or to the users. There are two ways to avoid these two undesired situations: 

1. by force, making use of the enforcement of an external law;
2. by mitigating the influence of the energy of the plutocratic vote;

I'll not describe the first solution, because it is, for now, out of consideration for our community. However, I want to add here also the notion that ***enforcement of the law** is the only way to prevent those two problems mentioned above*, beyond any doubt, where the plutocratic vote is used without mitigating its influence. (A case of this is EOS. There is no KYC, or VOICE identity provider, or any other means of linking identity with the account(s), that would refrain the intellect of an evil mind to gain the system in his favor. Of course, the implementation of an identity link into the blockchain will solve many other issues, but not those two mentioned problems here. For EOS, if they don't change the plutocratic vote system, they have to revive the **EOS Alliance** and reestablish the **Constitution** so that the enforcement of law takes place refraining these mentioned problems. However, this is a text for another chapter)

###### On mitigating the influence of the energy of the plutocratic vote
Since we are not going to make use of *enforcement of the external law*, for now, the restriction of the Sybil attack becomes obsolete. Because the fix to the problem caused by the Sybil attack doesn't address the vulnerability the plutocratic vote brings to the society where it is applied. The user or users with monetary value enough could use many people with their true identities in order to game the plutocratic society, or use only one. Again, only the enforcement of external law could alleviate this vulnerability. Or as it will be described below, we could change the voting system by mixing more human intention power (energies) into the voting system. In other words, by the mitigation of the plutocratic vote energy.

It is very important to understand that the Sybil attack has no relation of causality to the vulnerability of the plutocratic vote. That doesn't mean that we should not mitigate the Sybil attack for other reasons. And because of that, let's have a look and address the possibilities of how we could mitigate the Sybil attack. 

1.  A clear solution is the link of identity with the user account(s). And this can be achieved in many ways as follows.
    - Kown Your Customer (KYC);
    - VOICE identity provider: this is a sure thing by now, the only problem is how long it will take until it is available to the EOS community;
    - Worbli and UX blockchains might find it interesting to provide something like a proof of identity. Perhaps, this is an idea to follow up and check with them;
    - Civic blockchain would be an alternative if any of EOSIO blockchains doesn't come to help with this identity issue; 

2. Another solution would be negating the Sybil attack by mitigating the importance of the number of accounts;
3. Finally, a third solution is to make it very difficult to maintain more than one account in the system;

We can make all of those 3 alternatives above become obsolete if we narrow the possibilities of the next vote energy to a pre-established range of accounts. And that is what I am going to add to the next topic.

##### On the reputation vote: second energy added to the VDAC final vote weight
The community is working on the reputation vote, and we will describe here what the community decide, later. However, for now, I will write some thought I think may help in the composition of the reputation vote.

The reputation vote's energy is the power given to the user to change the outcome of the community, in a straight function to how he uses the platform. As a user of the Vigor platform, if his activity is good for the community, his reputation's energy goes up; but, if his activity is bad for the community then his reputation's energy goes down. Of course, good or bad are judgments that will be defined by experts, Andrew and the team, according to many financial variables. Also, those judgments should be intensified by the amount of money the users perform their activities, i.e., if a user's actions generate a bailout of $5, he should lose a small amount of his reputation's energy; however, if he generates a bailout of $5M, he should lose a big amount of his reputation's energy.

Moreover, I would like to suggest to not mix the reputation's energy with the plutocratic vote energy (this is not a necessity, but there is a reason here.) The reason is that if we do have them separate we will have more clarity on the voting system and more possibilities on how we can architect the voting system in order to create a more inclusive economy, yet attenuate the vulnerabilities mentioned so far.

##### On the NameToBe vote: third energy added to the VDAC final vote weight

## Concepts, words' choices and their definitions
In this part, as we move forward with our conversation,  we will write down the definition of the principal words used in this text. The purpose of this is to organize the text and have a place of easy access for future references.

#### Concept of the contingency of the use of blockchain as a means to achieve decentralization
I think it is paramount to understand that decentralization exists by itself in many systems alive or non-alive. Therefore, the use of blockchain is contingent on relation to the achievement of decentralization. **Practical conclusions**: with this understanding, we as a community can move forward to the achievement of decentralization without restraining ourselves by the morosity of technological developments. Tools like the DAC or Daclify are great tools and should be molded to our needs and not the other way around -even worst, would be to have seen the community's action being narrowed regarding decentralization because of the misapplication of those tools. In fact, we as a community could become completely decentralized without the use of those mentioned tools. That doesn't mean that we are not going to use those tools, but it is my hope that the approach to them is from now on completely different. Also, this concept does not imply the nonuse of blockchain, but its contingency regarding decentralization.

#### Sybil attack
Sybil attack (or pseudospoofing or sockpuppetry) is a tentative to manipulate a system by the means of creating more than one account -only systems that presuppose the use of one account per individual are vulnerable to such attack.

## Questions & replies 
This is an attempt to organize all relevant questions the community might raise -all questions are extremely valuable. Within our community, many valuable contributions have been made already and many more may come. Unfortunately, most of the time they are shared on other means of communication such as the Telegram where all of them virtually are lost for lacking organization. Now, here we can record them in order. And by doing so, all of those coming valuable contributions positively will add their value to the accomplishment of this text.

Here, along with the questions, we will have their respective answers potentially resolving the issue. 

As of in any other part of this text, any answer here can be modified at any time so that it might express a better solution to the proposed problem. Having this approach, we not only add value to the text but also save a lot of time. From now on, when we are presented with a similar inquire, we can simply refer to the already given answer. I hope the community appreciates this effort and that this might increase the velocity of our progress in writing this text.

 1. [My main pondering on Vigor Vision is do we wish it to be a vision for Vigor Protocol (the financial app) or do we wish it to be for the VigorDAC (the decentralized community)](https://t.me/vigorgov/41332) And this other one, [So - do we wish it to be a vision for Vigor Protocol (the financial app) or do we wish it to be for the VigorDAC (the decentralized community)?](https://t.me/vigorgov/41335) **Reply:** It seems like to me, there is no such thing as Vigor protocol without VDAC. And this understanding comes from Andrew's videos, his vision as written above, and many documents officials, and non-officials. The idea is not to create anything new but rescue the intention already thrown into a creational process. (Nevertheless, no need to mention the VDAC vision can be changed but only when it will be changed -and this would be up to the community to decide. Here as it seems like, this is not part of the scope of this text.) Accordingly, the vision doesn't create the community; instead, the community creates it and ought to maintain it by the means of a healthy repetition, subliminal, or direct as in the vision statement case. And the clarification and maintenance of the already made vision have been the main topic of this text so far.

___________________________________________________________________
So, please let's put some time and energy on this topic so that we can refer to it as we move forward with our conversation.

**Many thanks to all for reading it or editing it or both. Much appreciation on your way.**
