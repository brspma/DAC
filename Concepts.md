# Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC)
In this text, we are going to be using **Vigor Decentralized Autonomous Community** (**VDAC**) as an actual example of a possibly successful case of a DAC. Also here, when the word *"the" or "our" community* is used, it will always refer to VDAC unless otherwise notified.

### On its intention
VDAC is a group of people with the intention to actualize, within the group itself, the concepts of decentralization, autonomy, and community. Later on, we are going to talk more about it but for now let's bear in mind that it is very transformative to have this intention, the group's intention, written in the VDAC vision statement in order to have a very clear guide for all actions of VDAC members.

There are two pieces of texts that serve as guidance to the group’s intention achievement, also. To be known, the [approved constitution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigorstablecoin/constitution/master/constitution.md) and the [whitepaper](https://docs.vigor.ai/docs/en/whitepaper).  Nevertheless, it is paramount to remember, in case one has forgotten, that what governs the VDAC is the interpretation given to those two texts by the ones in charge of the group, in our case here, the ones called **custodians**.

### On its vision
Any community is a kind of organization and for its own sake, it should have a **vision** statement. The vision statement ought to be a picture of your organization projected many years into the future. It is how you see your organization in 20 or 30 years from now. Also, it is good to bear in mind that the vision of one organization has more to do with products or services it delivers to society.

### On its intention again
Even more important than the vision statement, is its **reasoning** statement or the **“why”** statement. This statement ought to give the reason why the organization wants to serve the society with its products or services. It is the big 'why' the organization is working towards its vision. And it has more to do with the moral behind the organization's products or services. Ultimately, it is the most profound differentiation of the organization and it is the reason why it exists.

Any misunderstanding of this concept above or delinquency in not giving the just amount of importance will most likely drive the organization into error. Where the organization will become schizophrenic -doing and saying one thing, yet walking towards another completely different thing.   

#### On an important detail about the statements
Bring in mind that many times the vision and reasoning statements come together in only one phrase, making it difficult to notice the two concepts within there. Nevertheless, if this is the case, they are within there hidden behind keywords. It is much better, though, to have it separated into two complete and clear sentences.  

* VDAC vision statement __________________________________.
* VDAC “why” statement _____________________________.

### VDAC vision statement
 In the [EOS Hot Sauce episode 65](https://eosnation.io/eos-hot-sauce-65/) we do have a sentence of Andrew in which he states the vision of VDAC, saying:

>“that crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users." 

And, if I may, I would like to suggest this as an addition, _"and for its users where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always."_ Then, the whole statement could be written as follows: 

VDAC’s vision statement: **To be that crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users and for its users where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always**.

## Let's start
Assuming that the vision is the one we have right now and that even if the community chooses to change all the words yet keeping the same meaning, we can start moving forward with this conversation. The first thing we want to have is the actual picture of the VDAC in the present. We will not mind why it is how it is, and we are not going to judge it as well. It is just a picture so that we can have a clear view of the situation. And with a clear understanding, we can create a narrative that will serve as a solution for any possible identified problem.

### On VDAC's picture: a simple narrative of what it is
VDAC snapshot of July 2020, shows as it follows: a group of people who identify themselves as a decentralized autonomous community and who express the intention of being a decentralized autonomous community too. The group has a financial product which is a platform where users can lend, borrow, and insure tokens. This platform runs on top of 2 tokens which essentially exercises functions of 3 tokens: 1- VIGOR token which value is a US dollar peg; 2- VIG token which is a utility token you can pay fees on the platform, you can be rewarded for using the platform or you can be rewarded for being a VDAC member. The VIG token is used as a final reserve token too. 3- There is a third function of VIG token which is essentially linked to the custodians, having nothing to do with the VIG token itself. This is the governmental function used as a vote that counts. Here we are going to refer to this third function as VIGG to differentiate it from VIG if the need to use this appears. Moving forward we see that among all group's actions, we want to separate them into 2: first, the ones registered on the blockchain, and secondly, the ones not.
 - Registered on the blockchain: 
	 - There are 4 ways to interact with the VDAC. Those interactions are divided into 2: it can be as users, or as members, or both. The group itself is divided into 3 classes of members representing 3 interactions: 
		 - The first class is made of the 21 most voted members, called custodians, and they are the only ones whose votes count, and the only ones who can assign the multsig contracts, therefore the only ones who do govern.
			 -**Governance**: This governance is made by the majority of custodians' votes where 11 votes, from the 21, can execute a multsig proposal. Therefore, only custodians can vote among themselves, and choose who gets in or who gets out. And there is no way how to interfere with that.
		 - The second class is made of members that have received at least one vote, called candidates, and they do nothing in the governance, and their main role is to be there serving as candidates to the custodian rule. 
		 - The third class is made of members that have received none vote, called just like members, and they do nothing in governance; they are just there. 
		 - The last interaction belongs to the users -they are only users of the product and do nothing in the governance.
	 - There is a payment method where all 3 classes of members receive VIG tokens, according to an equation, proportionally to how many votes they received (or received not,) and the amount set in their Request Reward Claim option.
 - Not registered on the blockchain: 
	 - The group has many human activities that can be easily summarized as follows: Conversation through group chats manly on the telegram, where people, mostly VDAC members, talk and come to agreements on very important matters such as governance, legal complacency, marketing, and also programming code. All of those conversations take place also through group calls manly on the Zoom platform.

## Concepts, words' choices and their definitions
In this part, as we move forward with our conversation,  we will write down the definition of the principal words used in this text. The purpose of this is to organize the text and have a place of easy access for future references.

### Concept of the contingency of the use of blockchain as a means to achieve decentralization
I think it is paramount to understand that decentralization exists by itself in many systems alive or non-alive. Therefore, the use of blockchain is contingent on relation to the achievement of decentralization. **Practical conclusions**: with this understanding, we as a community can move forward to the achievement of decentralization without restraining ourselves by the morosity of technological developments. Tools like the DAC or Daclify are great tools and should be molded to our needs and not the other way around -even worst, would be to have seen the community's action being narrowed regarding decentralization because of the misapplication of those tools. In fact, we as a community could become completely decentralized without the use of those mentioned tools. That doesn't mean that we are not going to use those tools, but it is my hope that the approach to them is from now on completely different. Also, this concept does not imply the nonuse of blockchain, but its contingency regarding decentralization.

## Questions & replies 
This is an attempt to organize all relevant questions the community might raise -all questions are extremely valuable. Within our community, many valuable contributions have been made already and many more may come. Unfortunately, most of the time they are shared on other means of communication such as the Telegram where all of them virtually are lost for lacking organization. Now, here we can record them in order. And by doing so, all of those coming valuable contributions positively will add their value to the accomplishment of this text.

Here, along with the questions, we will have their respective answers potentially resolving the issue. 

As of in any other part of this text, any answer here can be modified at any time so that it might express a better solution to the proposed problem. Having this approach, we not only add value to the text but also save a lot of time. From now on, when we are presented with a similar inquire, we can simply refer to the already given answer. I hope the community appreciates this effort and that this might increase the velocity of our progress in writing this text.

 1. [My main pondering on Vigor Vision is do we wish it to be a vision for Vigor Protocol (the financial app) or do we wish it to be for the VigorDAC (the decentralized community)](https://t.me/vigorgov/41332) And this other one, [So - do we wish it to be a vision for Vigor Protocol (the financial app) or do we wish it to be for the VigorDAC (the decentralized community)?](https://t.me/vigorgov/41335) **Reply:** It seems like to me, there is no such thing as Vigor protocol without VDAC. And this understanding comes from Andrew's videos, his vision as written above, and many documents officials, and non-officials. The idea is not to create anything new but rescue the intention already thrown into a creational process. (Nevertheless, no need to mention the VDAC vision can be changed but only when it will be changed -and this would be up to the community to decide. Here as it seems like, this is not part of the scope of this text.) Accordingly, the vision doesn't create the community; instead, the community creates it and ought to maintain it by the means of a healthy repetition, subliminal, or direct as in the vision statement case. And the clarification and maintenance of the already made vision have been the main topic of this text so far.

So, please let's put some time and energy on this topic so that we can refer to it as we move forward with our conversation.

**Many thanks to all for reading it or editing it or both. Much appreciation on your way.**
