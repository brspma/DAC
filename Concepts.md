 # Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC)

In this text, we are going to be using Vigor Decentralized Autonomous Community (VDAC) as an actual example of a possibly successful case of a DAC.

###On its intention
VDAC is a group of people with the intention of actualizing, within the group itself, the concepts of decentralization, autonomy, and community. 

There are two pieces of texts that serve as guidance to the group’s intention achievement. To be known, the [approved constitution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigorstablecoin/constitution/master/constitution.md) and the [whitepaper](https://docs.vigor.ai/docs/en/whitepaper). Nevertheless, it is paramount to remember, in case one has forgotten, that what governs the VDAC is the interpretation given to those pieces of papers by the **ones in charge.**    

###On its vision
Any community is a kind of organization and for its own sake, it should have a **vision** statement. The vision statement ought to be a picture of your organization projected many years into the future. It is how you see your organization in 20 or 30 years from now. Also, it is good to bear in mind that the vision of one organization has more to do with the product or service it delivers to society.

###On its motive
Even more important than the vision statement, is its **reasoning** statement or the **“why”** statement. This statement ought to give the reason why the organization wants to serve the society with its product by making its vision real in the future. Most of the time the vision and reasoning statements come together in only one phrase, making it difficult to notice the two concepts within there. Nevertheless, if this is the case, they are still within there hidden behind keywords. Much better is to have it separated into two clear sentences. Also, it is good to bear in mind that the reasoning statement has more to do with the moral behind the vision statement. It is the big **'why'** the organization wants to create a product or to deliver a service to the society in its part or as a whole.

* VDAC vision statement __________________________________.
* VDAC “why” statement _____________________________.

For instance, we do have a sentence of Andrew in which he states the vision of Vigor protocol.
```
“that crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users."
```
And, if I may, I would like to suggest this as an addition: _and for its users where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always._

Then, the whole statement could be written as follows: 

VDAC’s vision statement: 
```
That crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users and 
for its users where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always.
```
So, please let's put some time and energy on this topic so that we can refer to it as we move forward with our conversation.

Many thanks to all for reading it or editing it or both.
