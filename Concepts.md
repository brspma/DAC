# Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC)

In this text, we are going to be using Vigor Decentralized Autonomous Community (VDAC) as an actual example of a possibly successful case of a DAC.

### On its intention
VDAC is a group of people with the intention to actualize, within the group itself, the concepts of decentralization, autonomy, and community. Later on, we are going to talk more about why, in the first place, VDAC exists. But for now, let's bear in mind that it is very transformative to have this intention, the group's intention, written in the VDAC vision statement in order to have a very clear guide for all actions of VDAC members.

There are two pieces of texts that serve as guidance to the group’s intention achievement. To be known, the [approved constitution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigorstablecoin/constitution/master/constitution.md) and the [whitepaper](https://docs.vigor.ai/docs/en/whitepaper).  Nevertheless, it is paramount to remember, in case one has forgotten, that what governs the VDAC is the interpretation given to those two texts by **the ones in charge of the group.**

### On its vision
Any community is a kind of organization and for its own sake, it should have a **vision** statement. The vision statement ought to be a picture of your organization projected many years into the future. It is how you see your organization in 20 or 30 years from now. Also, it is good to bear in mind that the vision of one organization has more to do with products or services it delivers to society.

### On its intention again
Even more important than the vision statement, is its **reasoning** statement or the **“why”** statement. This statement ought to give the reason why the organization wants to serve the society with its product or service. It is the big **'why'** the organization is working towards its vision. And it has more to do with the moral behind the organization's products or services. Ultimately, it is the most profound differentiation of the organization and its reason why it exists.

Any misunderstanding of this concept above or delinquency in not giving the just amount of importance will most likely drive the organization into error. Where the organization will become schizophrenic -doing and saying one thing, yet walking towards another completely different thing.   

#### On an important detail about the statements
Bring in mind that many times the vision and reasoning statements come together in only one phrase, making it difficult to notice the two concepts within there. Nevertheless, if this is the case, they are within there hidden behind keywords. It is much better, though, to have it separated into two complete and clear sentences.  

* VDAC vision statement __________________________________.
* VDAC “why” statement _____________________________.

### VDAC vision statement
We do have a sentence of Andrew in which he states the vision of VDAC, saying:
```
“that crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users."
```
And, if I may, I would like to suggest this as an addition: _and for its users where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always._

Then, the whole statement could be written as follows: 

VDAC’s vision statement: 
```
To be that crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users and 
for its users where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always.
```
So, please let's put some time and energy on this topic so that we can refer to it as we move forward with our conversation.

Many thanks to all for reading it or editing it or both.
