 # Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC)

In this text, we are going to be using Vigor Decentralized Autonomous Community (VDAC) as an actual example of a possibly successful case of a DAC.

A community is a kind of organization and for its own sake, it should also have a **vision** statement. The vision statement ought to be a picture of your organization projected many years into the future. It is how you see your organization in 20 or 30 years from now. Also, the vision of one organization has more to do with the product or service it delivers to society.

Even more important than the vision statement, is its **reasoning** statement or the **“why”** statement. This statement ought to give the reason why the organization wants to create its vision. Most of the time they come together, but it is better if separated into two sentences. Also, the reasoning statement has more to do with the moral behind the vision, or how the organization’s vision is going to impact its members and the society as a whole. 

* VDAC vison statement__________________________________.
* VDAC “why” statment_____________________________.

For instance, we do have a sentence of Andrew in which he states the vision of Vigor protocol.
```
“that crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users."
```
And, I would like to suggest this as an addition:

and for its users, where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always.  

The underlined sentence is the “why” statement. The whole statement could be written as follows: 

VDAC’s vision: 
```
That crypto borrow and lend platform run by its users and 
for its users, where they can come and receive their meaningful share, always.
```
So, please let's put some time and energy on this topic so that we can refer to it as we move forward with our conversation.

Many thanks to all for reading it or editing it or both.
